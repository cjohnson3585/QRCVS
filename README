FIRST, mkdir a directory and cd to it

>mkdir ./GIT_REPO
>cd ./GIT_REPO

THEN CLONE THE REPO

>git clone https://github.com/cjohnson3585/QRCVS.git

CD IN TO QRCVS/

>cd QRCVS/



YOU ARE NOW IN THE TOP DIRECTORY. YOU WILL SEE DOCKERFILE, A START SCRIPT, IMAGES, TEMPLATES, 
SRC DIRECTORIES AND THE MAIN SCRIPT 'qrcodes.py'. CHECK IT OUT, IT CONSISTS OF A FLASK FRAMEWROK
AND JAVASCRIPT TEMPLATES AND HTML. NEXT INSTALL THE PYTHON DEPENDENCIES, THIS IS ASSUMING YOU ARE 
USING PYTHON 3. I AM NOT WORRYING ABOUT DOCKER RIGHT NOW, THE SCRIPT WORKS BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND AN
EASY  WAY TO SAVE OUPUT FILES IN A DOCKER CONTAINER SO WE WILL JUST RUN THE SERVER WITH FLASK FROM
THE COMMAND LINE.

RUN:

>pip install -r requirements.txt

THEN START THE SERVER BY JUST TYPING:

>python qrcodes.py

THEN NAVIGATE TO:

http://0.0.0.0:8000/ ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE TO SEE THE WEBAPP.

I AM CALLING IT QRCODES RIGHT NOW AND THINKING QRCVS IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE THREE TABS, 'GENERATE', 'READ', 'DATABASE', AND 'HOME'.
GENERATE IS THE ONLY ONE HOOKED UP ALL THE WAY THROUGH, THE OTHER TWO ARE PLACEHOLDERS WITH DUMMY HTML. 

GENERATE WILL TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER SCREEN ASKING FOR 'BUSNIESS CARD' OR 'ADVERTISEMENT'. CLICK 'BUSINESS CARD'. 

THE IDEA IS THAT YOU CAN GENERATE YOUR OWN QR BUSNIESS CARD AND HAVE IT SAVED ON YOUR PHONE AND YOUR PHONE IS NOW YOUR BUSINESS CARD
FOREVER. INFO LIKE NAME, WEBSITE, EMAIL, ETC. CAN BE CHANGED AND UPDATED AT ANY TIME.

AFTER CLICKING BUSINESS CARD, YOU ARE TAKEN TO A FILL IN SCREEN. FILL IN THE INFO (YOU WILL NEED A PHOTO OF YOURSELF OR ANY PHOTO THAT YOU WANT TO SHOW UP ON THE CARD). YOU CAN USE ANY OUTPUT PATH YOU WANT BUT INCLUDE THE OUTPUT FILE NAME TOO WITH A .png FORMAT. FOR THE 'POSITION TYPE', LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES I GENERATED: CJqr1.png and CJqr2.png. 1) PLACES THE QR CODE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND THE IMAGE MAKES UP THE BAKCGROUND OF THE CARD AND 2) PLACES YOUR IMAGE AT THE VERY CENTER AND THE QR CODE IS THEENTIRE BACKGROUND.

CLICK 'SUBMIT AND GENERATE QR CODE'.

PROVIDED EVERYTHING WORKS CORRECT, YOU SHOULD HAVE A POPUP OF YOUR QR CODE. SCAN IT WITH A QR READER (TONS OF FREE ONES IN THE APP STORE) AND IT WILL COME UP WITH ALL THE INFO YOU ADDED IN YOUR FILL SCREEN.

PLAY AROUND WITH THE APP AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU SEE OR WHAT WORKS OR DOES NOT WORK.
